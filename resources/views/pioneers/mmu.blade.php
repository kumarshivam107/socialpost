                <p class="text-justify">Maharishi Markandeshwar University, Mullana, officially Maharishi Markandeshwar (Deemed to be University), Mullana, is a deemed university at Mullana near Ambala in the state of Haryana, India. It was founded in 1993 in the name of Maharishi Markandeshwar Ji.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Accredited by NAAC as Grade A university, MM(DU) has built its goodwill as the best university of North India with a rich legacy of excellence in research, innovation and skill development. MM(DU) incorporates the best of both the worlds by presenting a synergy of curricula from both the UGC model of education and the leading schools from around the world.

                    The placement drive of  MM(DU) is nothing like students experience elsewhere. In a competitive world where the sole focus of trainers is just academia and job related queries and solutions, we at MM(DU) believe in the holistic development of the students and all their talents. We instill passion, creativity, encourage their unique thinking and give them confidence to innovate and think not just out of the box but far away from it where the perspective is futuristic yet realistic.</p>
    
                <p class="text-justify">The campus includes 14 hostels and six residential blocks. It has a sports complex with seven gyms, a swimming pool and one game arena. The campus has two shopping centers with four banks, a post office, and various eating shops. Also on campus there is an auditorium with seating capacity of about 1500.</p>
